These procedures are part of the Modula-2 ISO SYSTEM Module.

PROCEDURE ROTATE (val: <a packedset type>;
num: INTEGER): <type of first parameter>;
(* Returns a bit sequence obtained from val by rotating up/right
or down/right by the absolute value of num. The direction is
down/right if the sign of num is negative, otherwise the direction
is up/left.
*)
PROCEDURE SHIFT (val: <a packedset type>;
num: INTEGER): <type of first parameter>;
(* Returns a bit sequence obtained from val by shifting up/left
or down/right by the absolute value of num, introducing
zeros as necessary. The direction is down/right if the sign of
num is negative, otherwise the direction is up/left.
*)

We can use them for bitwise shift an rotate on BITSET types.
